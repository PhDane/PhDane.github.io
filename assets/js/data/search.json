(1991). The theory of planned behavior. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50(2), 179–211.SummaryIn terms of predicting action in specific situations, both disposition and personality traits have low accuracy, though their influence can be seen by observing behavior over a longer period of time. According to the theory of planned behavior, intention is central to the process of conscious thought translating into behavior. Stronger intention increases the probability of the behavior being completed. Intention takes into account a number of factors which either strengthen or weaken it.The theory of planned behavior specifies three specific factors that influence intention - perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, and attitudes towards the behavior. Perceived behavioral control refers to an individual’s belief concerning “the ease or difficulty of performing the behavior of interest” and the individual’s action-specific success expectancy. It differs from the concept of locus of control in that locus of control is generally longitudinally stable, while perceived behavioral control is specific to both situation and action. Perceived behavioral control shares common ground with both todo: link Bandura’s theory of self-efficacy (which is cited) and todo:link Seligman’s concept of learned helplessness (which is not). With intention being constant, increased perceived behavioral control will result in increased effort. In terms of empirical measurement and prediction, “perceived behavioral control can often be used as a substitute for a measure of actual control.”Subjective norms differ from social norms in that they deal specifically with the individual-level perceptions, rather than group-level perceptions. The influence of subjective norms was found to have less impact than attitudes towards the behavior - which are specified in terms of valence and strength. Though unstated, I would assume that the importance of subjective norms would increase for individuals with higher need for social validation.\\[\\Large {A \\propto \\sum_{i=1}^n b_i e_i}\\]This Attitude model, mathematically stated (and in a process similar to probability weighting), combines a “strength of each salient belief” measurement ($b_i$) multiplicatively with a “subjective evaluation of the belief’s attributes” ($e_i$). This process occurs for each of $n$ salient beliefs regarding an action, all of which are summed. The final result (called a “summative belief index”) is directly proportional to a person’s attitude ($A$) regarding a specific behavior. Interestingly, the model allows for $b$ and $e$ measurements to be either unipolar or bipolar (see p. 193), depending on theoretical justification, through the use of a simple linear adjustment.\\[\\Large {SN \\propto \\sum_{i=1}^n n_i m_i}\\]Similar to the Attitude model, the Subjective Norm ($SN$) model combines a bipolar measure of normative beliefs ($n_i$) multiplicatively with a unipolar measure of “motivation to comply” ($m_i$), across $n$ salient normative beliefs.\\[\\Large {PBC \\propto \\sum_{i=1}^n c_i p_i}\\]Finally, the Perception of Behavioral Control ($PBC$) model multiplicatively combines control belief ($c_i$) with the perceived power ($p_i$) of each control belief, again across $n$ control beliefs. Control beliefs deal with the belief an individual has regarding necessary resources and opportunities. The power of each control belief can be either positive (facilitatory) or negative (inhibitory).All three elements ($A$,$SN$,$PBC$) can be summed for a “measure of the overall behavior disposition.”ApplicationThe model has obvious applications for quantitatively modeling behavior probabilities. Additionally, this paper does a good job of setting forth and clearly explaining a quantitative model, with its respective elements." }, { "title": "Merton 1942 - A Note on Science and Democracy", "url": "/posts/merton-1942-a-note-on-science-and-democracy/", "categories": "Comps, Philosophy of Science", "tags": "comps, philosophy of science", "date": "2022-06-15 12:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "Google Scholar LinkMerton, R. K. (1942). A note on science and democracy. J. Legal &amp; Pol. Soc., 1, 115.Note: The normally-used citation for Mertonian norms is “The normative structure of science”, but I couldn’t find a digital copy of it. Anyway, this one came out the same year and is still quite good.I forget where I originally came across the concept of Mertonian norms (maybe from Simine Vazire’s condemning reply tweet about the Stanford Prison Experiment), but they resonated with me. Robert Merton was a Columbia professor who is regarded by many as the “founding father” of sociology. He popularized the terms “role model”, “unintended consequences”, and “self-fulfilling prophecy”. These terms are so widely used amongst the social sciences that I was honestly surprised to learn that that a single person was responsible for them. Long story short – he was a smart guy. Merton held that there are four “institutional imperatives” that “comprise the ethos of modern science.” They are universalism, organized skepticism, disinterestedness, and communism. Universalism and organized skepticism seem related, as do disinterestedness and communism.UniversalismUniversalism is the belief that truth is true, regardless of its source. In an increasingly politicized environment (though, as Merton noted, this is not a new thing), knowledge that falls outside party lines can increasingly be taken to task. Remember Donohue and Levitt’s “The impact of legalized abortion on crime”? This paper, made even more famous for its coverage in Freakonomics, said that states that allowed abortion before the 1973 Roe v. Wade case saw crime declines earlier than states that waited until 1973. The kicker is that these declines didn’t come until the 1990s, when the children who were aborted would have been approaching adulthood. In other words, the possible criminals of the future were instead aborted, thereby reducing crime rates. This finding infuriated conservative anti-abortion activists, who attempted to poke holes in the study. Regardless of one’s personal stance on abortion, it is an interesting case study. My takeaway from the idea of universalism is that we all preferentially treat knowledge with which we agree. This can be dangerous to the general public (it tends to squash diversity of thought) and especially to scientists, who are supposed to be knowledge’s gatekeepers. As a scientist, and even as a person, I should be open to the fact that I might be wrong.Organized SkepticismOn the other hand, we should not simply accept everything that is published in a journal (especially in today’s world of “pay to publish” journals). Merton calls this organized skepticism[^1]. Such unconditional acceptance can lead to situations like the current replication crisis. Instead, knowledge, especially knowledge that seems to fly in the face of already established knowledge, should be thoroughly vetted. One application of this organized skepticism can be seen in the peer-review process of journals. Another application, especially for more positivistic and quantitative research, involves looking at the statistical power of the experiments. In the same vein, good science can and should be replicated.todo: add in a note about Kuhn hereDisinterestednessMerton also made the point that scientists should, as a goal, be working for the benefit of the greater scientific community at large, as opposed to personal gain. Especially at a public university, tax dollars are being invested in the development of a PhD (one dean I talked to estimated the cost of a 5-year PhD to be anywhere from $300-$500k). There is an expectation that that investment will one day be repaid by advancements in knowledge provided by that PhD. In a day where the second largest hirer of economists (behind the Federal Reserve) is Amazon, more and more business PhDs are finding themselves working at tech companies. This isn’t necessarily bad, but if they are only contributing to proprietary knowledge, then that is bad. Knowledge needs to cross-pollinate (again, see that past point about replication), and knowledge that does not move will probably stagnate. Some companies have allowed researchers to publish (though this might be because the very best researchers wouldn’t work at a place where they couldn’t publish) - see Google’s immense contribution to NLP technologies.CommunismOn that same note, Merton advocates for common ownership of scientific knowledge, “The scientist’s claim to ‘his’ intellectual ‘property’ is limited to that of recognition and esteem.” That is an idea that flies firmly in the face of competitive edge and proprietary knowledge and non-compete agreements. Capitalism is, in essence, built around scarcity of resources and one of those resources is knowledge. Again, I’d like to sidestep a philosophical debate here, but I do agree with these impulses. So much of my learning has been through YouTube videos and online blogs, aside from just journal articles and books. I firmly believe that the learning that I’ve been able to access should be accessible to all. I’m pleased to see more and more articles available on Google Scholar (or even the probably-illegal Library Genesis). While I do believe that capital markets lend themselves to competition and competition can definitely swiftly advance knowledge, I’m not sure that we have yet, as a society, reached an optimal balance between proprietary and public knowledge.[^1] Merton actually spelled it as “scepticism” just in case someone is searching for that spelling." }, { "title": "Setting up a new Jekyll Blog", "url": "/posts/setting-up-a-new-jekyll-blog/", "categories": "General, Blog", "tags": "blog, Jekyll", "date": "2022-06-14 12:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "Knowing for a while now that I’d eventually need a website to showcase research, I’ve been on the lookout for solutions. I currently use Obsidian for a notes solution – and I like it quite a bit. It’s introduced me to Markdown, which has been very quick to learn. Additionally, Obsidian allows for LaTeX-like math using MathJax and has a great option for embedding code. Did I mention it’s free? What isn’t free however is Obsidian Publishing, which currently is $20 a month – more than I pay for 2TB of cloud storage from Google. This seems excessive for hosting what are essentially just text files (Obsidian files are stored as Markdown files).I’d seen other PhD students use markdown sites hosted on GitHub for material related to comprehensive exams and thought that looked like a good idea. Additionally, GitHub Pages uses Markdown, which would allow for easy cross-posting of my Obsidian notes (since they’re already Markdown).Unfortunately, someone already owned the URL for my name (thanks a lot Dane - just kidding, he’s actually a really nice guy!), so I bought PhDane.com and went about configuring the GitHub page as a custom domain. Turns out there is a great static site generator - Jekyll - which is widely used and has a large number of open-source themes available for use. I opted for using the excellent Chirpy theme, which also allows for MathJax and even Mermaid diagrams. It integrates some Google Analytics features that I might jump into in the future. I have no experience with Ruby (Jekyll is based on Ruby) or HTML/CSS and little experience with GitHub, but figured it out after a couple days. Jekyll Compose, though run through the command line, makes the blogging experience a bit quicker. Also, a good spell checker for your IDE can save you some time.ResourcesIf you’re interested in setting up a site like this, I’d suggest this video…And here’s the issue that hung me up for a bit…If you’re looking for a more basic site (that allows for more customizability without jumping into CSS), this video was fairly quick and straightforward.Honestly though, this 4-part series is the best one I’ve seen so far.
